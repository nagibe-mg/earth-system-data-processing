The format of the `outout` file is grib, a special format for gridded data that is used by meteorological services.
The xarray library cannot handle grib files.

But didn't we say that we wanted to get the data as netcdf?

Well, let us inspect the MARS request again: it doesn't specify an output format, thus it reverts to the default grib.

While we are fixing things: what else is wrong?

We were estimating a file size of 10 MBytes for the whole month, but instead we download 100 MBytes for 3 days!!

We did not specify the output resolution.

The two things that we need to add to the request are thus:
"grid": "5.625/5.625",
"format": "netcdf"

Then, let us also choose a proper filename which allows us to identify the content of this dataset later.
